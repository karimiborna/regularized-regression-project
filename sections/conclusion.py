Regularization has given us a completely new perspective on what makes a regression model “good.”  
In our early work with ordinary least squares (OLS), we focused on getting the **best possible fit** to the data.  
Now we see that the best fit in training is often the **worst fit for generalization**.  

Ridge and Lasso regression show us a tradeoff:  
- Ridge smooths out coefficients, stabilizing the model when predictors overlap.  
- Lasso goes further by selecting variables, helping us focus on the truly important features.

### Reflections as Students in Data Science

As master’s students just starting to grasp the intricacies of linear regression, this feels like a turning point.  
We are moving from the classical world of regression toward the world of **machine learning**, where the goal is not just to explain the past, but to **predict the future reliably**.  

Regularization is one of those first glimpses into the machine learning mindset:  
- **Don’t just fit — generalize.**  
- Accept some bias if it means reducing variance.  
- Favor models that will survive contact with new, messy data.

### Why This Matters for Our Field

In the data-driven fields we are entering, from **biomedical research** to **finance** to **social science**, data is often high-dimensional, noisy, and correlated.  
OLS alone will often collapse under those conditions. Ridge and Lasso, however, give us a principled way to **tame complexity** and avoid overfitting.  

We can already imagine how these techniques will be useful:  
- In genomics, where thousands of features may predict a disease outcome, Lasso can highlight the handful of key drivers.  
- In finance, Ridge can stabilize predictions when markets are volatile and features are strongly correlated.  
- In almost any scientific study, regularization helps us avoid chasing noise and instead extract meaningful, generalizable patterns.

### Final Thoughts

What excites us most is that this is just the **beginning**.  
Regularization sits at the boundary between classical regression and the machine learning methods we are about to explore more deeply.  
It teaches us humility — that more parameters and closer fits don’t mean better science.  
It also teaches us power — that careful penalties can make our models **smarter, simpler, and more trustworthy**.  

In many ways, this project has shown us not only a new method but a new way of thinking about modeling:  
**predicting well matters more than fitting perfectly.**
